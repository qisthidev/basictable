## 🚀 Publishing Steps

### 1. Verify npm Account Access
Since the package already exists on npm (maintained by jerrylow), you'll need to be added as a maintainer or have the ownership transferred.

**Check current maintainers:**
```bash
npm view basictable maintainers
```

**Contact jerrylow** to:
- Add you as a maintainer: `npm owner add rama@qisthi.dev basictable`
- Or transfer ownership completely

### 2. Login to npm
```bash
npm login
```
Enter your npm credentials:
- Username
- Password  
- Email: rama@qisthi.dev
- 2FA code (if enabled)

### 3. Final Package Verification
```bash
# Test what will be published
npm pack --dry-run

# Test the package locally
npm pack
npm install -g basictable-3.1.0.tgz
```

### 4. Publish to npm
Once you have maintainer access:

```bash
# Final build (automatic via prepublishOnly)
npm run build

# Publish the package
npm publish

# Or if you want to publish with tag first
npm publish --tag beta
npm dist-tag add basictable@3.1.0 latest
```

### 5. Verify Publication
```bash
# Check the published package
npm view basictable

# Install and test
npm install basictable@3.1.0
```
